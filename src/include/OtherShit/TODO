Physics Class:
    Abstract physics package
    Contains the constants
    Collision Detection (probably contain bounding box struct)
    2DVec struct (for forces and velocity and shit)

Might need some kind of interface defined before the physics class in order to accept each of these inside it

Object Class:
    The base class for all things (name wip)
    has color, position, and BB (bounding box)
    Can be collided with
    Has support for one-way platforms

DynamicObject Class:
    Subclass of Object
    Same thing as object but can move
    Feels forces, has velocity to update position

Player Class:
    Subclass of DynamicObject
    everything that dynamic does but accepts input from the player
    Should only be one made ever (except maybe for special levels)
